# Installation

zabbix-aggregate-reports is written and tested against python >=3.5. Consequently, any python management system willl likely work.

## Using a virtual environment

1. Clone the repo
2. `python3 -m venv env`
3. `. env/bin/activate`
4. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

This assumes the `venv` package is already installed on your system. Because this package may be managed by a system package manager, we won't suggest the best solution for installing it.
